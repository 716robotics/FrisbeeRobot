# [716](https://www.716robotics.com) Frisbee Demonstration Robot
Project is in progress. This branch is <span style="color:red">**not**</span> production ready.

## Purpose
This project aims to train new members of the software sub-team and to bring the frisbee robot back to life for demonstration.

## Features 
Features we'd like to see that have not yet been implimented (overview only, specifics will be posted in the projects section) 

- Critical
    - Drive Train (tank drive)
    - Manual override firing (step-by-step)
- General Priority
    - Automatic firing process
    - SmartDashboard selectable control scheme
        1. Classic - driver controls movement with differential joysticks, operator controls all other functions with xbox controller.
        2. Low Personel - All robot operations and movement are controlled by the xbox controller, sticks not needed.
    - SmartDashboard selectable deadman in driver and operator controls (classic scheme only) to be used when a spectator is controlling the other station.
- Low Priority
    - Color Sorting: The sensors that will be used to detect proximity in the magazing for automatic firing also detect color. The system could keep track of the color of each frisbee and (using gyroscope) throw each color of frisbee into distinct piles.
